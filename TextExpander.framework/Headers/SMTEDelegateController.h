// Protocol to implement to support fill-in snippets
@protocol SMTEFillDelegate <NSObject>

/* When an abbreviation for a snippet that looks like a fill-in snippet has been
 * typed, SMTEDelegateController will call your fill delegate's implementation of
 * this method.
 * Provide some kind of identifier for the given UITextView/UITextField/UISearchBar/UIWebView
 * The ID doesn't have to be fancy, "maintext" or "searchbar" will do.
 *
 * Return nil to avoid the fill-in app-switching process (the snippet will be expanded
 * with "(field name)" where the fill fields are).
 *
 * Note that in the case of a UIWebView, the uiTextObject passed will actually be
 * a NSDictionary with two of these keys:
 *     - SMTEkWebView          The UIWebView object (key always present)
 *     - SMTEkElementID        The HTML element's id attribute (if found, preferred over Name)
 *     - SMTEkElementName      The HTML element's name attribute (if id not found and name found)
 * (If no id or name attribute is found, fill-in's cannot be supported, since there is
 * no way for TE to insert the filled-in text in the correct location after focus is lost.)
 * Unless there is only one editable area in your web view, this implies that the returned
 * identifier string should include element id/name information. Eg. "webview-field2".
 */

- (NSString*)identifierForTextArea: (id)uiTextObject;

/* Usually called milliseconds after identifierForTextArea:, SMTEDelegateController is
 * about to call [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL: "tetouch-xc: *x-callback-url/fillin?..."]
 * In other words, the TEtouch is about to be activated. Your app should save state
 * and make any other preparations.
 *
 * This delegate method is optional, since "normal housekeeping" might save state anyway.
 *
 * The main difference between identifierForTextArea: and prepareForFillSwitch: is that
 * identifierForTextArea: is called when the snippet is triggered and based on the snippet
 * appearing to have fill-in fields, while prepareForFillSwitch: is called only if the
 * fill fields are known to be valid, and after the snippet abbreviation has been deleted from the text view/field.
 *
 * Return NO to cancel the process.

/* Restore active typing location and insertion cursor position to a text item
 * based on the identifier the fill delegate provided earlier.
 * (This call is made from handleFillCompletionURL: )
 *
 * In the case of a UIWebView, this method should build and return an NSDictionary
 * like the one sent to the fill delegate in identifierForTextArea: when the snippet
 * was triggered.
 * That is, you should make the UIWebView become first responder, then return an
 * NSDictionary with two of these keys:
 *     - SMTEkWebView          The UIWebView object (key must be present)
 *     - SMTEkElementID        The HTML element's id attribute (preferred over Name)
 *     - SMTEkElementName      The HTML element's name attribute (only if no id)
 * TE will use the same Javascripts that it uses to expand normal snippets to focus the appropriate
 * element and insert the filled text.
 *
 * Note 1: If your app is still loaded after returning from TEtouch's fill window,
 * probably no work needs to be done (the text item will still be the first 
 * responder, and the insertion cursor position will still be the same).
 * Note 2: If the requested insertionPointLocation cannot be honored (ie. text has
 * been reset because of the app switching), then update it to whatever is reasonable.
 *
 * Return nil to cancel insertion of the fill-in text. Users will not expect a cancel
 * at this point unless userCanceledFill is set. Even in the cancel case, they will likely
 * expect the identified text object to become the first responder.
